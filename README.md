# Captain's Log Front-End

## Getting Started

- Fork this repo
- Clone the forked repository
- `cd` to the directory where you cloned it
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm start` to start the react app on `localhost:3000`
- `npm test` (in a separate terminal tab) to open the cypress testing window (keep your react app runnign as well)

> _Note_: Remember to `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` regularly

Using the [Captain's Log API that you built](https://github.com/joinpursuit/captains-log), you are going to create a frontend-only app.

Don't forget to keep your back-end API running during this build.

### Build the Following Components/Pages/Routes

### Nav Bar

At the top of your app you should have a navigation bar.

- It displays links to each primary route (`/logs`, `/logs/new`) at the top of the page.

Your app should also include the following routes:

<hr />

### INDEX: GET `/logs`

- Displays a list of `log.title` that are clickable to take the user to `/logs/:index`.

**IMPORTANT**

Make sure your first logs are the ones shared in [captain's log API](https://github.com/joinpursuit/captains-log)

Starting with:

```js
module.exports = [
  {
    captainName: "Picard",
    title: "Courage",
    post: "Courage can be an emotion too.",
    mistakesWereMadeToday: true,
    daysSinceLastCrisis: 100,
  },
  {
    captainName: "Ahab",
    title: "Whale",
    post: "By heavens man, we are turned round and round in this world, like yonder windlass, and fate is the handspike.",
    mistakesWereMadeToday: true,
    daysSinceLastCrisis: 20,
  },
  {
    captainName: "Sarah Lance",
    title: "Vandal Savage",
    post: "I’d tell you to go to hell, but you’d probably just feel at home there.",
    mistakesWereMadeToday: true,
    daysSinceLastCrisis: 0,
  },
  {
    captainName: "Ahab",
    title: "Insolence",
    post: "I don't give reasons. I give orders!",
    mistakesWereMadeToday: true,
    daysSinceLastCrisis: 100,
  },
  {
    captainName: "Sarah Lance",
    title: "Ava",
    post: "Ava's the kind of girl that you take home to your parents, and I am the kind you take to an exorcism",
    mistakesWereMadeToday: true,
    daysSinceLastCrisis: 0,
  },
  {
    captainName: "Ahab",
    title: "What is sleep?",
    post: "Sleep? That bed is a coffin, and those are winding sheets. I do not sleep, I die.",
    mistakesWereMadeToday: true,
    daysSinceLastCrisis: 5,
  },
  {
    captainName: "Sarah Lance",
    title: "Jonah Hex",
    post: "I know you don’t like taking orders from a woman, but you’re gonna like getting your ass kicked by one even less.",
    mistakesWereMadeToday: true,
    daysSinceLastCrisis: 0,
  },
];
```
